          Control Working Group (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/speechsc-charter.html" target="_blank">Speechsc</a>)
          of the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="http://www.ietf.org" target="_blank">IETF</a>) to allow client hosts to
          control media processing resources such as speech synthesizers, speech recognizers, speaker
          verifiers and speaker identifiers residing in servers on the network.
