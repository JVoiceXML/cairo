Release Notes for cairo-sip v0.1:
=================================
The cairo-sip library provides a simple Java API for supporting SIP/SDP message
communication between MRCPv2 clients and servers.

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session Description Protocol
(SDP) are critical elements of the Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2
(MRCPv2) standard as described in the MRCPv2 specification:

   "MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol - it relies on a session management
   protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish the
   MRCPv2 control session between the client and the server, and for rendezvous
   and capability discovery. It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the
   media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink
   and the media server."

This is the first release for the cairo-sip project.  This release provides the
necessary SIP and SDP capabilities required for implementing MRCPv2 clients and
servers.
