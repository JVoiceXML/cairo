Release Notes for Cairo v0.2:
=============================

Project Cairo sets out to provide an enterprise grade, Media Resource
Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) compliant speech server solution
utilizing existing open source speech resources.

Version History
---------------

Cairo v0.2 adds support for establishing sessions using Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) signalling and improves speech recognition performance by
matching the voice models used by Sphinx to the sampling rate of the
received audio data.

Cairo v0.1 implemented support for speech synthesis and speech recognition
functionality using Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) for
the control channel between the speech client and the speech resource and
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for streaming audio to and from the
media sink/source.


Change Log for Project Cairo:
=============================

Cairo v0.2:
-----------
* Use SIP instead of Java RMI for session initiation.

* Use the WSJ 8khz acoustic model instead of the 16khz model for speech
recognition processing.  The 8khz model matches the sampling rate of the
codec used for RTP audio data and as a result recognition performance is
much improved.


Cairo v0.1:
-----------
No prior release to compare with.
