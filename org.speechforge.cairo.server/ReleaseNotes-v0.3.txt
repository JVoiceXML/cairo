Release Notes for cairo-server v0.3:
====================================

Cairo-server is an open source speech resource server written entirely in the
Java programming language.  Cairo-server builds upon pre-existing open source
speech projects such as FreeTTS and Sphinx and adds additional functionality
to meet the requirements necessary for use in enterprise scale deployments of
speech/telephony applications.


Version History
---------------

Cairo-server v0.3 - adds improved support for speech clients by adding hotword
recognition mode, playback of pre-recorded prompts, SIP softphone integration
and termination of active requests and sessions from the client.  Natural
language processing has also been added and there have been further
improvements made in the areas of endpointing and speech recognition
performance.  Additionaly, this release also factors out some common code into
3 new sub-projects: cairo-rtp, cairo-sip and cairo-client. What was previously
Cairo has now been renamed to cairo-server.

Cairo v0.2 - adds support for establishing sessions using Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) signalling and improves speech recognition performance by
matching the voice models used by Sphinx to the sampling rate of the
received audio data.

Cairo v0.1  - implements support for speech synthesis and speech recognition
functionality using Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) for
the control channel between the speech client and the speech resource and
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for streaming audio to and from the
media sink/source.


Change Log for Project Cairo:
=============================

Cairo v0.3:
-----------

* Cairo has been renamed to cairo-server and re-usable SIP and RTP related
functionality has been factored out into separate cairo-sip and cairo-rtp
projects for use by both speech servers and speech clients.

* Adds support for detection of out-of-grammar responses.

* Adds support for hotword barge-in mode.

* Now runs on Linux out of the box with provided shell scripts for launching
speech server processes.

* Adds support for direct connection from SIP softphones like Xlite by
implementing the SIP REGISTER method.

* Adds handling of SIP BYE requests which are used to trigger the immediate
release of speech resources at the completion of an active session.

* Recognition performance has been improved by a number of methods, including
adjusting the garbage collection strategy and better start and end of speech
detection (endpointing).

* RTP transmission has been improved with the use of a JMF workaround to ensure
20ms packet size. 

* Adds support for playback of pre-recorded prompts on the speechsynth channel.

* Adds natural language processing to obtain a semantic interpretion of the
utterance based on the grammar.


Cairo v0.2:
-----------

* Use SIP instead of Java RMI for session initiation.

* Use the WSJ 8khz acoustic model instead of the 16khz model for speech
recognition processing.  The 8khz model matches the sampling rate of the
codec used for RTP audio data and as a result recognition performance is
much improved.


Cairo v0.1:
-----------

No prior release to compare with.
